                        and I may not have much IT experience; however, I believe that I will gain more academic knowledge 
                        and skills during university. Besides in class, I am studying Python coding from external sources 
                        and building some simple programs for practicing and enhancing my skills now.

            <p class="info-text">
            Our group project is about how a game can act as an effective learning environment by integrating 
            reflection into the process of play while studying in lecture or tutorial class. The game here 
            resembles a legendary Mario game, however, the extraordinary here is the unique playstyle, a character 
            in game that has to answer the question as soon as possible to get a higher mark and pass to another 
            high level . The player uses the directional arrows on the keyboard to negotiate the direction of character 
            to jump or to go left and right.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            The point element in the game could help students stay focused on their studying and increase the 
            competitiveness among students in class to optimize the efficiency in the field of education.

          <li class="geninfo">Motivation:</li>
          <div class="info">
            All of us chose this idea because we wanted to experience and learn how to build a game by ourselves. 
            One study of the popular multiple-choice quiz game Kahoot found that it improved students’ attitudes 
            toward learning and boosted their academic scores. Most games are about entertaining and valuable awards 
            that make individuals have a sense of achievement, however we want to create a brand new value in games 
            that are educational. We do believe that our project is interesting because it can be applied in reality 
            and brings huge efficiency. This will be in fit with current IT trends, because people's demand for 
            entertainment in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak is higher than ever. Furthermore, a  future manager 
            should be able to see that we are tech enthusiasts that are always up to date on the IT industry and have 
            game development experience as a result of this.

            Among countless entertainment games, one stood out the most and they are Nintendo. Nintendo is a global 
            Japanese video game corporation headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. They are well-known for creating video games 
            and game consoles. However, they mostly focus on the game for amusement purposes, whereas our venture aims 
            to transcend beyond this. We decided to include some interesting features in our product, such as a quiz 
            and a shopping cart. Students may engage more in class with quizzes, while the store features with accumulated 
            coins generate a sense of success in players, keeping them in the game as long as feasible.

            While all members of our group have a huge interest in the game industry, we decided to create a game 
            by ourselves. However, due to the members lacking experience and knowledge about programming,  the aim 
            of this project is to create a basic platform game. A platform game or platformer is a style of game 
            where the player has to control the character moving through obstacles in the given environment to 
            complete the level.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            First of all, our game is programmed using pygame, which is a suite of cross-platform Python modules 
            for creating video games. It offers sound and graphics libraries that may be utilized with the Python 
            programming language. There are a range of basic features that the game needs to follow:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Game world: An environment for the character to move around </li>
              <li>Game main character: A figure that player can control to play this game</li>
              <li>Obstacles: Block the player in some locations</li>
              <li>Enemies: Locate in specific locations in each map, they try to attack when encounter the player</li>
              <li>Stuff to collect: Bonus point if the player collect on the way</li>
              <li>Quests to complete: tasks that required player to complete in order to gain rewards</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="info-text">
            Our first priority is to make the game run smoothly with those functions as mentioned above. Besides that, 
            we are developing extra levels for multiple difficulties and various designs for the map as well.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Moreover, we also design a website to present our project with a better view and easier access to each part.
            </p>
            </ol> 
        </div>

          <p class="info-text">
            In this section, we are going to describe our project details, how we have planned and collaborated to 
            make this project come out successfully. We have created tasks for the group to follow and to track our 
            own progress.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Group formation and idea discussion</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Our group formed at the beginning of the semester since we were all familiar with each other before the course started. 
            This made our teamwork and communication much easier. We planned to choose an idea for the project to follow and then 
            recognized that all of us have the same interest in games, so we decided to create a game based on what we are learning, 
            which is Python. 
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Planning</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            First and foremost, we split the project into small parts for easy to maintain and each person has a specific role for 
            each part. However, we also set up deadlines every week and help each other for their parts when they are struggling, 
            we work together to finish everything before the deadline.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Secondly, we work as a team to complete multiple tasks that require collaboration.  We will be actively involved in daily 
            communication with other team members for improvements and help because this requires a lot of group activities.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Next, we would like to make a website to present our group project documentation, which is in charge of Tin. Besides Python, 
            we are using HTML and CSS for front-end website creation. The website will contain the main idea of this project and the 
            summary of the documentation.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            About our code, we decided 2 people to take over all of the code creation. These people will have less tasks on the 
            documentation, however, they have responsibility for the whole game as the main code writer and game designer.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Finally, we will make the PowerPoint slides as the last part after we finish making the game and website. It is also 
            the last part of the project.   
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Docummentation</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            To ensure that the documentation is consistent, we are using the same rules and font designs. For a clear 
            visual, we will mostly use Times New Roman font with a font size of 12 and 1.15 line spacing.   
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            All documentations are stored on Google Docs and everyone has access to update and record the progress 
            online regularly.   
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Collaboration tools</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            For efficiency, a group project requires an atmosphere that encourages cooperation and teamwork. 
            Furthermore, frequent communication helps in the resolution of miscommunications and ensures that everyone 
            is meeting deadlines and taking responsibility for their job.   
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            We choose Discord and Messenger as our main communication tools since they are very familiar with our group 
            members. We use Messenger regularly to communicate about daily problems and goals of the project since 
            everyone has a Facebook account. Discord is for weekly meetings and file sharing.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            For code collaboration, we use GitHub as a cloud repository platform to store our code and keep track of changes.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Google Docs is going to be our main tool of keeping track of our documentation file, where everyone has a part 
            in the report and will be updating regularly.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Game Design</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            First of all, we will try to make the game playable and contain basic functions that we designed at first 
            and follow standard platformer rules. There will be a game main character moving through the map avoiding 
            obstacles and enemies to complete a level. Moreover, we want to make our game more prestigious by adding 
            sound effects and animations. 
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Web Design</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Tin is the one who came up with an idea of using a website to demonstrate the project. He also learnt about 
            web programming languages such as HTML CSS and Javascript so Tin is going to take care of this part.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Presentation</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            We will start preparing our presentation slides last week when we all finished the game and the website. 
            The presentation will include the main ideas of this project and we will try to make the duration as close 
            as possible to meet the requirements.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Progress</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Due to early group formation, great communication and teamwork, we have quite a lot of time for completing 
            this project. We do not have any time management problems at all and that is a huge advantage for us.  We 
            started researching Pygame and making games with Pygame from the very beginning. We spent a lot of time 
            understanding the game logic, fundamentals and art design. We also invest our time in exploring web design 
            and development. Despite being new to game and website development, we have done better than we expected. 
            We have created a playable game with certain levels and fulfill all requirements that we planned from the 
            beginning. Our website is well-designed and includes everything we need to demonstrate about the project.

          Scope and Limits
        </div>
        <div id="s_lim" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Several hours were spent deliberating among the members of our team before agreeing on a three-phase scope, with each phase having its own set of objectives and limits. During this first phase, we're primarily concerned with building the framework for the breadth of our many activities. The goal of this phase is to finish all the background work, which includes writing portions of the report and putting together the essential structure for our games. The second phase of our endeavor included developing a version of our game that was oriented toward people. Many things must be done for this to be successful. In the first instance, we could create a platform that would allow individuals to log in using their own accounts. Second, creating a database to store information about the stages the user has completed as well as coins and bonuses earned while playing the game, which includes establishing a technique and creating at least a few game levels. The scope of the project has been expanded in the third phase to include the creation of a working game that may potentially be sold or at the very least used as a proof of concept for a future commercial enterprise. Therefore, substantial polishing, the acquisition of all essential assets, the implementation of all marketing activities, and the completion of the game itself will be required. As soon as the game is released, a "stretch goal" is considered depending on the number of copies sold, and maybe more events, skins, and incentives for players are added to the game's roster.

        <div id="tool_tech" class="info" style="display: none;">
            <p class="info-text">There are several tools and technologies that are required for the creation of the game 
              as well as its continued development:
            </p>

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Pygame package from Python:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            The pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language specifically intended 
            to help people  make games and other multimedia applications. However, due to our lack of experience 
            in programming, it seems to us that this tool would take many weeks to get used to it. Phu, who plays 
            a main role in developing games, has done some research to find tutorials on Youtube that help us to 
            deal with this challenge.
            </p>
          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Adobe Photoshop CC:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            This design application belongs to Adobe’s toolkit and is free for RMIT  students. It’s also a powerful 
            tool to help Phu design a character and a basic background for our project.

          Testing
        </div>
        <div id="test" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Our group will divide the testing stage into certain steps. The first step is to test code functions and behaviors 
          by playing the game and debugging any problems that arise. For the game logic, we will let two testers who specialize 
          in IT major and also one consultant in Student Academic Success (SAS) test the game. Due to that, they can give us 
          helpful advice and we find out inappropriate points in the game to fix. After completing the technical step, we will 
          move to the social step, which is the attraction. Assuming that our game becomes popular as an educational combined 
          game model as we need to provide people with useful information from the quizzes and also a good experience. Therefore, 
          we need to collect lots of feedback from players in order to improve the quality of our game. To do that, we will urge 
          our friends in class to try that game.

          Risks
        </div>
        <div id="risk" class="info" style="display: none;">
          It is hard to avoid any risk when starting up and working towards the end of a project. These are 2 risks that we identify and speculate regarding our project:
          <div class="break"></div>
          <ul class="list" style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 1: Financial:</li>
            <div class="info">
              Like most forms of software development, the team will make no revenue from the duration of the work itself. Indeed, there are some startup pages such as Kickstarter, but it comes with many risks. It could be that the demo may not reach many people or not many feels interested in it yet. Hence, the ground funding campaign may not be enough to support members during the time. Unlike a lot of other forms, game developers usually make game without guaranteed customer even when the product is completed. The team will usually suffer financial loss during the producing time. However, if the project takes too much time or if the sales forecast was misread or wrong, the team will face even worse loss. As a small team, we will be burdened by time pressure and economic cost during the period of producing this project. We speculated them so we chose to have an adequate scope for this project in order to minimize this risk, but this does not fully eliminate it. If the expenses required to walk through this project to the end are above average starting capital, even if it is a passion project, the opportunity cost could result in the team dissolution.
            </div>
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 2: No demand:</li>
            <div class="info">
              As mentioned above, one of the most dangerous risks for a video game is when there is not enough buyer leading to minimum or even no sales. Each project relies on forecasting tools to determine how success the project will be. Demand risk refers to the forecast might not give the accurate prediction. No matter the reason, in an industry built around pushing demand, a project will sink and can lead to studio closure if the scope was too big. While our project is small, we do not have the same marketing power like an entire industry because the project will be constructed ourselves with a fluctuated financial and is mostly fueled more by passion than reason. The fear of no demand towards our project is realistically apprehensive. However, the project had been intended as more of a learning experience rather than creating a product that is globally viral. Although we may experience damage in finance lost, we still manage to learn from the work we have done and bring entertainment to customers even in just a short time.

        <div id="gr_com" class="info" style="display: none;">
          As a result of our team's formation since the beginning of the semester, we have known enough about the skills and work attitude of each member. 
          Thanks to this, it is highly beneficial for our group to be able to allocate the appropriate tasks for everyone that they do best to acquire 
          more efficiently. First, we use Messenger to discuss and send documents related to the assignment. Every Saturday evening, our group meetings 
          take place on the Discord platform, where you can call and share the screen to ensure that all members can see what’s going on. By doing this, 
          we could tackle the problem together and each meeting would typically last 2 hours.We update and analyze the project's development throughout 
          the meeting, as well as discuss what we did last week and what we'll accomplish next week. Tin also takes responsibility for writing 
          Meeting Minutes on Google Docs so that we can review them later and those who are unable to attend the meeting may read them and keep up 
          with the assignment's progress. Before the weekly meetings, each member will note down what they want to add such as any innovative ideas 
          for the game’s future development, or recommendations for the report or website. Last but not least, we choose Google Docs to write the 
          report since it is more convenient for us to manage our group process and amend the report during our weekly meeting.

        most of the time, our work even went well. </dd>
        
      <dd>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to work from home because I can't go to Ho Chi Minh city
        soon. Therefore, I hope that in other classes, we could spend more time working with each other, and do our best
        to learn.</dd>
        
      <dd>My surprise was how much we learned in this class. It's important to study on our own during this project as
        well as in class. This will help us do our project the best. I think it's great because I can learn about things
        I didn't know before.</dd>
        
      <dd>What I learned from working in a group is how to get along with each other better. Everybody did their best
        to finish their own work, so we split the work up. If we looked at each person's strengths, then they could be
        given the jobs that are their favorite."</dd>

        dedicated to me, I got to learn many and many new things while working as a peer with them. Personally,
        regarding the previous assignment, I think the tasks were divided logically, and that we worked quite
        efficiently and on time prior to the deadline.</dd>
      <dd>Truthfully, the trouble I had struggled with was the technical side of each of our assignments, which we
        will be updating a website. I was very unfamiliar with how HTML and GitHub worked as I had had little to no
        background knowledge about this field before. I made quite a lot of mistakes working with GitHub at the early
        state of our assignment. I even accidentally merged the old codes once which caused our leader to re-write a few
        lines. However, thanks to my teammate, I am confident that I am better at maintaining it now.</dd>

        however, since the early ages, I was interested in playing games with my friends, I feel bored when doing
        everything alone, therefore, I really enjoy working with people, especially, anyone that have related field as
        me, for example: IT.</dd>
        
      <dd>I managed to separate the works from the contents of our assignment step by step, what we should do with
        this part, who is going to do it, which parts need more people to deal with, and what the most important thing
        when doing the task, for the website, it is a little bit hard for my group, even though I have experienced in
        programming before, this is still the first time I have to learn about web development to finish our assignment.
        But I enjoyed every moment, it is good to know a very well-known aspect of IT, it is the world of world wide
        web, and learn how to design and deploy a website is very crucial, which will further my knowledge more.</dd>
      <dd>Everybody is a little bit confusing at the beginning, but it is fine, we are just new and first time working
        with each other, but at the end, everything turns out to be perfect. My team members managed to finish their
        tasks and they have already learnt and understood some of web development along the way, which will be a vital
        tool for them in the future, for myself, I enjoy the experience of leading a team, hosting meeting every week,
        divide the tasks equally among members considered their strength and weaknesses, moreover, ask my teammates to
        ask when they are in trouble, but at least, try to do some research first before asking.</dd>
      <dd>With this project, the most struggle thing is the game development using JS, I must do lots of research and
        how to connect and organize modules logically to easily assign tasks or manage the source code. But at the end,
        I understand more about how to organize the code base, not the best, I hope I will get better in the future.
        Moreover, it is quite tricky when designing the sticky side bar on the website, but I managed to finish it, I
        hope in the future, I can tackle and perfectly fixing the bugs and moreover, illustrate my knowledge to my team
        members as well."</dd>

      <dd>"In my opinion, my group in general and my teammates are perfect. Together we created a nice working and
        studying environment, we are ready to help our teammates when someone have difficulty doing something by finding
        the trouble and think for the best way to solve it.</dd>
      <dd>Although our group must work from home, we don’t have the opportunity to meet face to face. I hope in the
        foreseeable future, we will have another chance to work together in other classes because we are congenial with
        each other’s.</dd>
      <dd>But what takes my impression is that the amount of knowledge that we learned in this course by completing
        the task that Minh assigned and together we build a perfect assignment by checking for the errors of the Word
        document and website by meeting via Microsoft Teams.</dd>
      <dd>My personal experience from this course that is we could know how to work as a team, working in a group
        environment. In addition, we also know we must be responsible for the task that the team captain assigned for
        each people to follow the group’s progress. By utilizing the Divide and Conquer strategy, we split the
        assignment into smaller pieces and then each people with different advantages could to their best job. I am
        really appreciating that I can work with this team, everybody makes me feel like I am with my family."</dd>
