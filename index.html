  <div style = "padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 40px;">

        <ul class="list">
          <li class="geninfo">Topic:</li>
          <div class="info">
            Our group project is about a site that individuals can unwind by playing a game. The game here resembles a Ping Pong game, however, the extraordinary here is the unique playstyle, a basic ball bouncing game that assists the player with invigorating their brain from upsetting day by keeping the ball ricocheting to procure focuses, no rivalry, just player and the ball. Reward element could be at explicit focuses that arbitrary snags will seem to expand trouble of the game.
           <div class="break"></div>
            For the higher perspective, we need to assemble a little game site that contains different games that are not serious, for no reason in particular and loosen up reason as it were. As a general rule, a site that requests clients register, to save their information and afterward add month-to-month occasion for the player, about games reward highlight.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">Motivation:</li>
          <div class="info">
            This venture is significant and intriguing because that most games are about to contest and high award that makes individuals concentrate and exceptional, yet with our undertaking, the primary objective is a 1-player venture all through bunches of games. This will fit in the IT drifts fine and dandy assuming we can scale this site that includes heaps of engineers to deal with every particular game. Besides, a future manager will see that we are equipped for the web advancement region.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">Landscape:</li>
          <div class="info">
            The comparison of the task right currently depends on the conventional Ping Pong game, yet soon everybody will see the interesting side of our undertaking, no aggressive game yet enjoyable to play. Assuming we figure out how proportional our site is to incorporate more scaled-down games, our rival could be y8, an extremely well-known web game for youngsters including heaps of smaller than usual games, yet the thing that matters is that it is serious and for the most part are multiplayer mode. Our venture will chiefly zero in on 1-player and game that main spotlight engaging not rivalry. Additionally, the player will get reward occasion for the game they play, could be more plunders, more elements…

        </div>
        <div id="Aim" class="info" style="display: none;">
          As of late, the venture has effectively had a game like Ping Pong, because of our colleagues' absence of information and experience, we are an only novice to programming so the task isn't finished, be that as it may, this undertaking can be feasible soon not a little while ago. Besides, this venture predominantly assists us with acquiring experience and information in web improvement, for the most part like a jungle gym for us to examine and test valuable things we think of.
          <div class="break"></div>
          First and foremost, the principal objective is to acquire information concerning how HTML, CSS, and JS work through and through to make an intelligent site for our report substance, and a bundle of JS programming to definitely make the game screen and the game rationale. We figure out how to set up everything to make a site that shows all our report content and furthermore the game. Be that as it may, we will attempt in the future to make it turn into a worldwide game site not only for nearby utilization.
          <div class="break"></div>
          Furthermore, we expect to foster a site that requires clients to register to save their data into our data set to make extraordinary occasions for them or to give them more advantages when playing on our site. Which conceivably, we need to concentrate on a system in the backend to interface with the information base to definitely carry out the business rationale. Also, we really want to get a system from the frontend to arrange our code module for the front-end side and make it more intuitive.
          <div class="break"></div>
          At long last, to make our task feasible to everybody, rather than utilizing GitHub arrangement, which simply facilitates a static site, we will really send our site utilizing some famous suppliers like Netifly, Heroku, AWS, etc. which will require some DevOps abilities. All in all, in a not-so-distant future, we will study and figure out things to create and full-fledged gaming site for everybody.

        <ul id = "plan_pro" class="list" style="margin-top: 0px; display: none;">
		</div>
            <p class="info-text">
            In this section, we are going to describe our project details, how we have planned and collaborated to 
            make this project come out successfully. We have created tasks for the group to follow and to track our 
            own progress.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Group formation and idea discussion</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Our group formed at the beginning of the semester since we were all familiar with each other before the course started. 
            This made our teamwork and communication much easier. We planned to choose an idea for the project to follow and then 
            recognized that all of us have the same interest in games, so we decided to create a game based on what we are learning, 
            which is Python. 
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Planning</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            First and foremost, we split the project into small parts for easy to maintain and each person has a specific role for 
            each part. However, we also set up deadlines every week and help each other for their parts when they are struggling, 
            we work together to finish everything before the deadline.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Secondly, we work as a team to complete multiple tasks that require collaboration.  We will be actively involved in daily 
            communication with other team members for improvements and help because this requires a lot of group activities.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Next, we would like to make a website to present our group project documentation, which is in charge of Tin. Besides Python, 
            we are using HTML and CSS for front-end website creation. The website will contain the main idea of this project and the 
            summary of the documentation.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            About our code, we decided 2 people to take over all of the code creation. These people will have less tasks on the 
            documentation, however, they have responsibility for the whole game as the main code writer and game designer.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Finally, we will make the PowerPoint slides as the last part after we finish making the game and website. It is also 
            the last part of the project.   
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Docummentation</b>

            To ensure that the documentation is consistent, we are using the same rules and font designs. For a clear 
            visual, we will mostly use Times New Roman font with a font size of 12 and 1.15 line spacing.   
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            All documentations are stored on Google Docs and everyone has access to update and record the progress 
            online regularly.   
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Collaboration tools</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            For efficiency, a group project requires an atmosphere that encourages cooperation and teamwork. 
            Furthermore, frequent communication helps in the resolution of miscommunications and ensures that everyone 
            is meeting deadlines and taking responsibility for their job.   
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            We choose Discord and Messenger as our main communication tools since they are very familiar with our group 
            members. We use Messenger regularly to communicate about daily problems and goals of the project since 
            everyone has a Facebook account. Discord is for weekly meetings and file sharing.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            For code collaboration, we use GitHub as a cloud repository platform to store our code and keep track of changes.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Google Docs is going to be our main tool of keeping track of our documentation file, where everyone has a part 
            in the report and will be updating regularly.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Game Design</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            First of all, we will try to make the game playable and contain basic functions that we designed at first 
            and follow standard platformer rules. There will be a game main character moving through the map avoiding 
            obstacles and enemies to complete a level. Moreover, we want to make our game more prestigious by adding 
            sound effects and animations. 
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Web Design</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Tin is the one who came up with an idea of using a website to demonstrate the project. He also learnt about 
            web programming languages such as HTML CSS and Javascript so Tin is going to take care of this part.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Presentation</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            We will start preparing our presentation slides last week when we all finished the game and the website. 
            The presentation will include the main ideas of this project and we will try to make the duration as close 
            as possible to meet the requirements.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Progress</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Due to early group formation, great communication and teamwork, we have quite a lot of time for completing 
            this project. We do not have any time management problems at all and that is a huge advantage for us.  We 
            started researching Pygame and making games with Pygame from the very beginning. We spent a lot of time 
            understanding the game logic, fundamentals and art design. We also invest our time in exploring web design 
            and development. Despite being new to game and website development, we have done better than we expected. 
            We have created a playable game with certain levels and fulfill all requirements that we planned from the 
            beginning. Our website is well-designed and includes everything we need to demonstrate about the project.

		<!--           <li class="geninfo">- Plan:</li>
          <div id="Plan" class="info">
            Our undertaking is separated into three primary stages:
            <div class="break"></div>
            The starting stage is about the substance of our undertaking, including a point of arrival for our site which presents our task, and every connected substance, and a demo game that we will deal with here which is a diverse form of Ping Pong game. Also, we will convey fewer mini games with the same methodology as our first game, for instance, adding like 4,5 additional games. At this stage, generally, it is about HTML, CSS, and JS, so we can get to know these mechanisms.
            <div class="break"></div>
            The subsequent stage is tied in with building a point of arrival for our clients to register and log in so they can approach occasions, remunerates each time they play the game, and so on, in addition, we need to store our clients' data with the goal that we secure their information just as giving markdown to them or adding more reward when they are messing around. At last, it is deploying our site on the internet. With this stage, it is fundamental for us to involve a framework for our frontend (for instance: ReactJs) to plan a beautiful site with important components like register, login, divert to the game, in addition, we will have our backend utilizing NodeJs and a database like MySQL or MongoDB to store our clients' data just as the business rationale for our site. Finally, it is figuring out how to send our site with some free cloud specialist co-ops, we can deploy the frontend utilizing Netlify and the backend with Heroku.
            <div class="break"></div>
            The third stage is about PR for our gaming site, which should update our site page dependent on Web optimization SEO, which represents Search Engine Optimizer, a site standard to augment the opportunity for the site to appear to the clients while they are riding the web. In addition, this is the ideal opportunity for investigating and proceeding to keep up with the site during this stage. 
            <div class="break"></div>
            Our project began when we are playing League of Legend together, it was supposed to be fun and stress-relieved, however, it turned out to be so much competitive and intense. That was where we decided to come up with a game that people feel fun to play and not competitive after all, and we want to get involved in web development as well, because 95% of the world of IT are websites, in a result, we want to make a gaming website, easy to get access to and games that are fun and not competitive.
            <div class="break"></div>
            As we plan through and accomplish, when we come to the dead end, at least we will have some experience in developing a website as well as develop a game on a website. That is, at the end we had a website the show moderate contents and a playable game. From that on, we can continue to progress with our project further.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">- Progress:</li>
          <div id="Progress" class="info">
            With limited for 4 weeks, we have managed to develop a playable Ping Pong as what we desired from the beginning, each bounce the player receive one point, we manage to put on sound as well as cool point feature, and a game over screen. Moreover, we manage to manipulate HTML, CSS and JS for showing our contents for the report on our website as well as the game. The biggest problem right now is time, and we are too new with web development and game development, if we want to finish this project, we need more time to research as well as sharpen our programming skill, we believe that in near future, we will be able to develop a fully functional gaming website.
            <div class="break"></div>
            As we are new to web development as well as game development, we manage to acquire some basic HTML, CSS and JS for our website and using canvas with JS to create the game. About the game, it is all about object-oriented programming, physics and math combination. We have to calculate how the ball react when hit the wall, when it hit the wall as well as the paddle. It was very buggy at the beginning, right now it is less but still not very smooth to play, however, the logic is still fine and playable.
            <div class="break"></div>
            We managed to change our content several times, at first, everybody come up with their own design while learning HTML, CSS, JS by themselves, and then we pick the most voted design and design based on that for whole project page. Coming to the game design, we are using canvas, which is a built-in from HTML and JS, we look up some algorithm to make the ball bouncing as well as hitting different object, moreover, we manage to put up some more features likes sound, point, ending screen, etc.
            <div class="break"></div>
            For the contents, we try to complete all the contents of the report as soon as possible and then move on to the presentation and then we will try to put them all up on our website.

          Roles
        </div>
        <div id="roles" class="info" style="display: none;">
          From the onset, our team didn’t have any specific role because our captain’s aim is that get us familiar with the tools that we need to use during the assignments such as HTML, CSS programming languages as well as GitHub. But on the further development of our project, there must be specific roles for each member necessary for the project. The team leader, who will have the responsibility for maintaining, managing the group or any outsource personnel. When the project is on the verge of fully developed, PR specialist will be needed to bring the product to commercial such as propagandize about the positive of the product to attract the players. A team member in our group can be filled in this position but the most suitable character is that who have the expertise on the Marketing area, which will be hired to do the PR tasks. In addition, there will be a design director to manage the UI/UX design of the project or upgrading the game mode and functions.

          Scope and Limits
        </div>
        <div id="s_lim" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Several hours were spent deliberating among the members of our team before agreeing on a three-phase scope, with each phase having its own set of objectives and limits. During this first phase, we're primarily concerned with building the framework for the breadth of our many activities. The goal of this phase is to finish all the background work, which includes writing portions of the report and putting together the essential structure for our games. The second phase of our endeavor included developing a version of our game that was oriented toward people. Many things must be done for this to be successful. In the first instance, we could create a platform that would allow individuals to log in using their own accounts. Second, creating a database to store information about the stages the user has completed as well as coins and bonuses earned while playing the game, which includes establishing a technique and creating at least a few game levels. The scope of the project has been expanded in the third phase to include the creation of a working game that may potentially be sold or at the very least used as a proof of concept for a future commercial enterprise. Therefore, substantial polishing, the acquisition of all essential assets, the implementation of all marketing activities, and the completion of the game itself will be required. As soon as the game is released, a "stretch goal" is considered depending on the number of copies sold, and maybe more events, skins, and incentives for players are added to the game's roster.

        <div id="tool_tech" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Our project main technologies are HTML, CSS, and JS altogether with some JS framework for the backend (NodeJS) and frontend (ReactJS), as well as a cloud service provider to host our website online. HTML, CSS and JS are all free online, but for the deployment, it is charged each month based on the cloud service provider that we choose, but we will try to demo it using free one associated with Heroku or Netlify.

          Testing
        </div>
        <div id="test" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Our group will execute the testing stage by playing the game on the different network platform such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and on different operating system to check if the game works smoothly with different operating system or not. Additionally, for the game logic there will be three different testers that work in the IT industry for a long time testing the game for us. With their support, we will be able to spot nearly all the bugs in our game even though it just a minor bug. When the testing stages is completed, all the members and testers will have a meeting and determine if the game was developed successful when all the members agreement. Furthermore, the players will be a crucial essence determining the successful of the game by filling in the customers review form.

          Risks
        </div>
        <div id="risk" class="info" style="display: none;">
          It is hard to avoid any risk when starting up and working towards the end of a project. These are 2 risks that we identify and speculate regarding our project:
          <div class="break"></div>
          <ul class="list" style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 1: Financial:</li>
            <div class="info">
              Like most forms of software development, the team will make no revenue from the duration of the work itself. Indeed, there are some startup pages such as Kickstarter, but it comes with many risks. It could be that the demo may not reach many people or not many feels interested in it yet. Hence, the ground funding campaign may not be enough to support members during the time. Unlike a lot of other forms, game developers usually make game without guaranteed customer even when the product is completed. The team will usually suffer financial loss during the producing time. However, if the project takes too much time or if the sales forecast was misread or wrong, the team will face even worse loss. As a small team, we will be burdened by time pressure and economic cost during the period of producing this project. We speculated them so we chose to have an adequate scope for this project in order to minimize this risk, but this does not fully eliminate it. If the expenses required to walk through this project to the end are above average starting capital, even if it is a passion project, the opportunity cost could result in the team dissolution.
            </div>
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 2: No demand:</li>
            <div class="info">
              As mentioned above, one of the most dangerous risks for a video game is when there is not enough buyer leading to minimum or even no sales. Each project relies on forecasting tools to determine how success the project will be. Demand risk refers to the forecast might not give the accurate prediction. No matter the reason, in an industry built around pushing demand, a project will sink and can lead to studio closure if the scope was too big. While our project is small, we do not have the same marketing power like an entire industry because the project will be constructed ourselves with a fluctuated financial and is mostly fueled more by passion than reason. The fear of no demand towards our project is realistically apprehensive. However, the project had been intended as more of a learning experience rather than creating a product that is globally viral. Although we may experience damage in finance lost, we still manage to learn from the work we have done and bring entertainment to customers even in just a short time.

          In every Wednesday evening, our group meetings take place. Our group meetings usually start when all the members finished their dinner to have the best spirit to dedicate their ideas. If one the members of our group cannot attend the meetings, we will explain for that member the content of that meeting and provide that member with the record of the meeting since we recorded every meeting to watch again to do the task effectively. The meeting usually occurs about three to four hours and the meeting must be organized every week to catch up with the progress of the assignment. In addition, if the problem that we need to solve is important, we will spend more time to solve it together. We usually using Microsoft Teams platform to organize the weekly meetings; besides that, we also use Messenger to discussing and sending documents related to the assignment. Moreover, we keep our assignment on track by using Microsoft Word SharePoint to do the report together since we divided the assignment into smaller pieces and each person will be responsible for some sections. Additionally, we can manage our group process and fix the report on the weekly meeting. As an embodiment, all the members could see that who have completed their tasks and who didn’t have their task fulfilled yet. Before the weekly meetings, every member in our group will write down what they have done in the previous week, what they want to contribute such as any new ideas, suggestion for the report and website or even the further development of our game.

      <dd>"I think our group is so great. Fortunately, I was able to work with great people who helped me a lot with
        this project. We work efficiently and everyone could do things in their forte, so although we worked from home
        most of the time, our work even went well. </dd>
        
      <dd>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to work from home because I can't go to Ho Chi Minh city
        soon. Therefore, I hope that in other classes, we could spend more time working with each other, and do our best
        to learn.</dd>
        
      <dd>My surprise was how much we learned in this class. It's important to study on our own during this project as
        well as in class. This will help us do our project the best. I think it's great because I can learn about things
        I didn't know before.</dd>
        
      <dd>What I learned from working in a group is how to get along with each other better. Everybody did their best
        to finish their own work, so we split the work up. If we looked at each person's strengths, then they could be
        given the jobs that are their favorite."</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt style="color:rgb(55, 115, 167); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 0px">Nhat Tien:</dt>
      <dd>"Although I was the last member to arrive at the group, I felt fortunate to be here. Everyone is nice and
        dedicated to me, I got to learn many and many new things while working as a peer with them. Personally,
        regarding the previous assignment, I think the tasks were divided logically, and that we worked quite
        efficiently and on time prior to the deadline.</dd>
      <dd>Truthfully, the trouble I had struggled with was the technical side of each of our assignments, which we
        will be updating a website. I was very unfamiliar with how HTML and GitHub worked as I had had little to no
        background knowledge about this field before. I made quite a lot of mistakes working with GitHub at the early
        state of our assignment. I even accidentally merged the old codes once which caused our leader to re-write a few
        lines. However, thanks to my teammate, I am confident that I am better at maintaining it now.</dd>
      <dd>Working with the other team members enhanced my ability to perform and be responsible with the tasks
        assigned. I do really feel that I have learnt a ton from my teammates and from these assignments as well."</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt style="color:rgb(51, 105, 153); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 0px">Hong Tin:</dt>
      <dd>"This is the first time I lead a group of newcomers so at first, I feel a little bit of overwhelming,
        however, since the early ages, I was interested in playing games with my friends, I feel bored when doing
        everything alone, therefore, I really enjoy working with people, especially, anyone that have related field as
        me, for example: IT.</dd>
        
      <dd>I managed to separate the works from the contents of our assignment step by step, what we should do with
        this part, who is going to do it, which parts need more people to deal with, and what the most important thing
        when doing the task, for the website, it is a little bit hard for my group, even though I have experienced in
        programming before, this is still the first time I have to learn about web development to finish our assignment.
        But I enjoyed every moment, it is good to know a very well-known aspect of IT, it is the world of world wide
        web, and learn how to design and deploy a website is very crucial, which will further my knowledge more.</dd>
      <dd>Everybody is a little bit confusing at the beginning, but it is fine, we are just new and first time working
        with each other, but at the end, everything turns out to be perfect. My team members managed to finish their
        tasks and they have already learnt and understood some of web development along the way, which will be a vital
        tool for them in the future, for myself, I enjoy the experience of leading a team, hosting meeting every week,
        divide the tasks equally among members considered their strength and weaknesses, moreover, ask my teammates to
        ask when they are in trouble, but at least, try to do some research first before asking.</dd>
      <dd>With this project, the most struggle thing is the game development using JS, I must do lots of research and
        how to connect and organize modules logically to easily assign tasks or manage the source code. But at the end,
        I understand more about how to organize the code base, not the best, I hope I will get better in the future.
        Moreover, it is quite tricky when designing the sticky side bar on the website, but I managed to finish it, I
        hope in the future, I can tackle and perfectly fixing the bugs and moreover, illustrate my knowledge to my team
        members as well."</dd>

      <dd>"In my opinion, my group in general and my teammates are perfect. Together we created a nice working and
        studying environment, we are ready to help our teammates when someone have difficulty doing something by finding
        the trouble and think for the best way to solve it.</dd>
      <dd>Although our group must work from home, we don’t have the opportunity to meet face to face. I hope in the
        foreseeable future, we will have another chance to work together in other classes because we are congenial with
        each other’s.</dd>
      <dd>But what takes my impression is that the amount of knowledge that we learned in this course by completing
        the task that Minh assigned and together we build a perfect assignment by checking for the errors of the Word
        document and website by meeting via Microsoft Teams.</dd>
      <dd>My personal experience from this course that is we could know how to work as a team, working in a group
        environment. In addition, we also know we must be responsible for the task that the team captain assigned for
        each people to follow the group’s progress. By utilizing the Divide and Conquer strategy, we split the
        assignment into smaller pieces and then each people with different advantages could to their best job. I am
        really appreciating that I can work with this team, everybody makes me feel like I am with my family."</dd>
